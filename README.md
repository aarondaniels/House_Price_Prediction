# House Price Prediction
This exercise uses a linear regression model to evaluate features of a house that are most predictive of the final price. A dataset for housing data is cut into train and test where the train will establish the parameters for the linear regression. The R<sup>2</sup> value for the linear plot will be used to assess strength of the prediction.
